Ingredients
2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour

½ teaspoon baking soda

2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature

½ cup granulated sugar

1 cup packed light brown sugar

1 teaspoon kosher salt

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

2 large eggs

12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips (2 cups)

Directions
Preheat oven and prep baking sheets:
Preheat oven to 350°F with racks in the upper and lower third positions. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

Combine flour with baking soda:
In a small bowl, whisk together flour and baking soda; set aside.

Beat butter and sugars:
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and both sugars on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.

Add salt, vanilla, and eggs:
Add salt, vanilla, and eggs; mix to combine. Reduce speed to low.

Add flour mixture gradually:
Gradually add flour mixture, mixing until just combined.

Mix in chips:
Mix in chocolate chips.

Portion cookies onto baking sheets:
Using a tablespoon measure or a small ice-cream scoop, drop heaping portions of dough about 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets.

For uniform cookies, we like to use a small ice-cream scoop to evenly portion the dough.

Bake cookies:
Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes.
Cool and store:
Transfer cookies to a wire rack and let cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.
